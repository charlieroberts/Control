Control
========

THIS IS THE DEVELOPMENT VERSION AND LOTS OF STUFF CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK.

Right now I know OSC and MIDI transmission / reception works. Buttons, Sliders, Knobs, MultiButtons, MultiSliders and the Accelerometer all work as of 1/28/2012. 

CHANGES
There are no more globals except for the Control object. So, oscManager is now Control.oscManager.

The interface format has changed. Here is a sample interface:

	Control.data = {} // store any variables here

	Control.functions = { // any functions you'd like to call. You can use 'this' to indicate the widget triggering the function
		sliderTouch : function() {
			console.log("slider value = " + this.val);
		}
	}

	Control.interface = {
		name : "test",
		orientation : "portrait",

		pages : [[
		{
			name: "slider2",
			type: "Button",
			bounds: [.0,.0,.5,.5],
			ontouchstart: Control.functions.sliderTouch,
		},
		{
		    name: "refresh",
		    type: "Button",
			bounds : [0,.8,.2,.2],
		    isLocal: true,
		    mode: "contact",
		    ontouchstart: Control.interfaceManager.refreshInterface,
		    stroke: "#aaa",
		},
		]],

		constants : [],
	}

You don't have to put your functions / data in the Control object (you can use globals), but this is the recommended way to do it and certain features might eventually depend on it. Note that we no longer use strings for event handlers. Actually, technically a string will still work, but it's more efficient to use a function pointer. You can also use an anonymous function if you want to pass arguments. Please ask any questions in the forum!!!
